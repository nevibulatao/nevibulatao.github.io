- In creating a github page, the process is very streamlined in a way that after creating a repository, all you have to do is clone it onto your local repository and then proceed working as usual. The most important step is following
  the step in naming and cloning provided in the guide provided in pages.github.com

- My key takeaway from this is getting a different approach in developing a webpage. In the past, I used to simply throw random elements together thru trial and error, hoping that I will reach the desired layout through brute force.
  After this exercise, I see web development differently, in a way that I can see better how each elements are actually coded and how they interact with one another. I look forward to practicing more regarding web develoment.
